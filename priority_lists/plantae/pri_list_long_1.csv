Flowers are bright pink and star-shaped with five petals[11.  Cattle may eat saltmarsh rush, but other livestock avoid it. Rabbits sometimes eat its flowers[11.  Saltmarsh rush inhabits salt marshes but has spread away from the coast along salted roadways[12.  It is now found in Vermont where it is introduced[11.  It is mainly a coastal species occurring at the high tide mark on the Mediterranean Atlantic Baltic and Black sea shorelines of Europe and the east coast of North America[12.  It also occurs inland in parts of eastern Europe west and central Asia particularly on saline soils[12.  In North America it occurs along the shorelines of areas once flooded by the sea and as a weed along railway lines for example in Minnesota[12.  In Indiana it is the only Juncus species found in the Tipton Till Plain a Till Plain in the Glacial till plains[12.  It is native to Europe and Western Asia where it grows in moist meadows[8.  Description Hypericum maculatum is a hairless perennial herbaceous plant growing to about 60 cm. The stem is square in cross section but without the wings shown in H. tetrapterum. The leaves are simple entire (undivided) and in opposite pairs without stipules and have few or no translucent glands. There may be black dots on the leaves petals and sepals 1 The flowers are yellow up to about 25mm across. The species hybridises with Hypericum perforatum to produce Des Etang’s St John’s wort Hypericum x desetangsii 1 Uses It is considered to be a medicinal plant 4 Hypericum maculatum herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea or oil extract and externally as oil extract ointment or cold maceration in ethanol for treatment of disorders of the skin locomotor system nervous system gastrointestinal tract respiratory tract kidneys and urinary tract cardiovascular system infections rheumatism and gout.
