The English name of the plant, Lady's Bedstraw, alludes to the same.

The pleasant, honey-like fragrance of the flowers, and the smell of hay from the dried leaves, made this plant suitable for use as a stuffing in mattresses. It was often mixed with other aromatic herbs and ferns to help keep vermin away from the bed.","Yellow ant has also been used as a beer spice, and has also had some use as a dye plant.
