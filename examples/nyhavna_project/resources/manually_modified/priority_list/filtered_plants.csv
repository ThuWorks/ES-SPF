One had to pick the plant with the left hand, after asking permission. Wearing Prikkperikum protected against fevers and colds, made soldiers invisible and attracted love. Plants gathered on Midsummer's Eve or on a Friday and worn on the body kept mental illness at bay and cured melancholy. When Prikkperikum was placed in a window, it protected against lightning, fire and evil spirits. Both the flowers and the leaves could be used for this purpose. The herb could also be dried over the midsummer bonfire and hung near a window to keep ghosts, sorcerers and other ill-wishers away from the house, and it could be burned to banish spirits and demons.

If the plant was placed under the pillow of an unmarried woman, she would dream of her future husband. The herb could be used in rituals or carried to detect other magicians, and was once held to the mouths of accused witches in an attempt to force a confession.","It has traditionally been used to treat burns, cuts, bruises and wounds. It is also known for its ability to fight depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), social phobia, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD)8.

Flowers are bright pink and star-shaped with five petals[11.  Cattle may eat saltmarsh rush, but other livestock avoid it. Rabbits sometimes eat its flowers[11.  Saltmarsh rush inhabits salt marshes but has spread away from the coast along salted roadways[12.  It is now found in Vermont where it is introduced[11.  It is mainly a coastal species occurring at the high tide mark on the Mediterranean Atlantic Baltic and Black sea shorelines of Europe and the east coast of North America[12.  It also occurs inland in parts of eastern Europe west and central Asia particularly on saline soils[12.  In North America it occurs along the shorelines of areas once flooded by the sea and as a weed along railway lines for example in Minnesota[12.  In Indiana it is the only Juncus species found in the Tipton Till Plain a Till Plain in the Glacial till plains[12.  It is native to Europe and Western Asia where it grows in moist meadows[8.  Description Hypericum maculatum is a hairless perennial herbaceous plant growing to about 60 cm. The stem is square in cross section but without the wings shown in H. tetrapterum. The leaves are simple entire (undivided) and in opposite pairs without stipules and have few or no translucent glands. There may be black dots on the leaves petals and sepals 1 The flowers are yellow up to about 25mm across. The species hybridises with Hypericum perforatum to produce Des Etang’s St John’s wort Hypericum x desetangsii 1 Uses It is considered to be a medicinal plant 4 Hypericum maculatum herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea or oil extract and externally as oil extract ointment or cold maceration in ethanol for treatment of disorders of the skin locomotor system nervous system gastrointestinal tract respiratory tract kidneys and urinary tract cardiovascular system infections rheumatism and gout.

In the Norse saga era, the yellow ant was consecrated to the fertility goddess Frøya and was therefore called frøyagrass. It was believed that placing a bundle of the herb in the maternity bed alleviated pain during childbirth. Placed in the child's cradle, it was supposed to keep witches and sorcery away. From Christian times, we have the legend that it was the sweet-smelling, soft, yellow-flowering ant that the Virgin Mary used in the manger for the baby Jesus. The old folk name Jomfru Marias sengehalm, which is known from many places in the Nordics, refers precisely to this popular legend. The English name of the plant, Lady's Bedstraw, alludes to the same.

The pleasant, honey-like fragrance of the flowers, and the smell of hay from the dried leaves, made this plant suitable for use as a stuffing in mattresses. It was often mixed with other aromatic herbs and ferns to help keep vermin away from the bed.","Yellow ant has also been used as a beer spice, and has also had some use as a dye plant.
